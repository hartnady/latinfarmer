1,Academic,"Academic This card's sole use is as a stepping stone to the minor improvements that
require 3 or 4 occupations, and is fine (but not spectacular) in that narrow
role. At best he is saving you 1F1A to just play another Occ. Usually, the
benefit will be less than that due to the fact that playing 2 different occs
would give you at least some sort of beneficial effect.",2,https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/436563/card-card-full-review-occupations-agricola-v111,G (I-K)
2,Acrobat,"Acrobat The ability to occasionally get a free plow along with your two or three food
is usually too strong to pass up. The card would be playable if this was all it
did, but the fact that you can also go for a grain if the plow space gets
blocked pushes the card even further. This is a very solid play that will act
like a Seasonal Worker early and get you 2 or 3 food to go with your plows
later. A tad unreliable but extremely powerful; this is the best 'claim' card.",4,https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/436563/card-card-full-review-occupations-agricola-v111,B (E-G)

4,Alms,"Alms Alms This card can be a bit awkward to play with, as a
lot of the time you're going to have an early game occupation that you'll want
to play instead. However, if you don't have anything that you need to play
immediately, this is usually a great play. There's no need to wait forever - if
you fire it out Round 4, 3 food and starting player is already a good deal.
Best of all, unlike other pass cards, this will usually never see play after
you use it, because the player to your left will most likely have already played
an occ. As you pass the card, be sure to sigh dramatically. 'I guess I
have to give you guys this awesome card now...' I'm sure your opponents will appreciate the humor.",3,https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/458895/card-card-full-review-improvements-agricola-v105,I (K) - E (C)
5,Alternative Designer," Mostly a combo card. Without a combo, only really useful for late-game fencing in low wood games. With some imagination, can be part of some very silly cheap-room combos. ",1,https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/604332/stategic-review-new-g-deck-occupations,E (C)
6,Animal Breeder,"Animal Breeder Can be simply absurd. This card is useful whether you choose to go the baking
or ranching route, assuming you can pay him the requisite food. If you are a baker, use this late game, then fence twice to get yourself a pair
of boar and cattle. If you fence twice and then let your cattle breed twice and
your boar breed once, this Occ has traded 6 food (1 + 2 + 3) and an action for
7 VPs. Ridiculous. If you're a rancher, careful wood and food grabs can get you two cows before
the second harvest. Equally sick, especially in combination with minors like Ox
Team or Milking Stool. Don't be afraid to fence a single pasture with this guy.",4,https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/436563/card-card-full-review-occupations-agricola-v111,D (E-K)
7,Animal Dealer,"Animal Dealer If you choose to just eat the extra animals immediately, this is going to be a
6 food play if you only take every animal once - almost worth it, but not quite
given that the food is given over time. However, this guy is much stronger than that. He lets you be the first person
to get 2 of an animal, which is especially important if an animal card comes up
the turn before a harvest. He also allows you to spam the animal spots for
food, denying other players from getting the animals they need. Superb.",4,https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/436563/card-card-full-review-occupations-agricola-v111,C (E-K)
8,Animal Farmer, Nice card to have in your hand. With a bit of work it can be a nice 5-point play in Round 14. Animal Farmer is better than some similar cards in EIK like Estate Manager or Organic Farmer. ,3,https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/604332/stategic-review-new-g-deck-occupations,B (K)
9,Animal Feed,"Animal Feed Animal Feed This can be worth 1 or 2 VPs, and it's free, so
don't forget about it. However, getting even 1 VP out of it might be tricky,
because you'll have to have adequate room, 4 planted fields, and exactly the
right numbers of animals for this to work. Usually this ends up staying in my
hand, just because of the sheer awkwardness involved in getting it to give you
anything.",2,https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/458895/card-card-full-review-improvements-agricola-v105,I (K) - E (C)
10,Animal Handler,"Animal Handler The best use for this guy is to play him as a baker that never takes animals
for the entire game. The sheep can fit in your house, and the boar and cattle
can go into stables/pastures that you build later. If you do that, you've spent
1F1A for 6 points - a pretty sweet deal. However, this best case scenario only applies when you choose to take no
animals for the entire game. This is a huge opportunity cost: it gives everyone
else free reign of the animals. Moreover, housing the cattle is usually an
awkward proposition. He comes at the beginning of round 14, before 'renovation
also fences' (aka the baker's best friend). This means that you have to either
build a second stable or build pastures. If you're building pastures, you're
probably going to want to take some animals for breeding, which in turn cuts
down on this Occ's benefit. Finally, you're required to play him at the
beginning of the game, when actions are most important. If you plan on breeding and eating animals, this guy has very little utility. The
animals just come too late. Moreover, if you already have two cow, the next cow
is worth about one half of a point. If you have 2 sheep, the next sheep is
worth about a third of a point. In a situation where you are going to grab
every animal anyway, this guy will only be worth about a point - a terrible
deal.",2,https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/436563/card-card-full-review-occupations-agricola-v111,D (E-K)
11,Animal Holder," I’m a fan of all of the 1/2/3/4 wood occupations, and this is no exception. It’s usually harder to predict the Animal Holder’s bonus early in the game than the bonus of some EIK cards, like Village Elder or Reeve, but still potentially a nice play early or late. ",3,https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/604332/stategic-review-new-g-deck-occupations,D (K)
12,Animal Keeper,"Animal Keeper The best case scenario is if you craft a single large 2x2 pasture with a stable
in it. Then you'll be able to house all the animals you could ever want. In
this outstanding case, what has he saved you? About 2 wood! Let me explain. It is very rare to have more than 4 of each animal. Even in a
game where a person is able to achieve a lot of animals, pressures for food
will cause them to eat quite a few. As a result, you could have just used 2
wood to split the megapasture down the middle. This should allow you to keep a
fair amount of 2 different animals, with a single one of the third animal
taking up the space in your house. Sure, you might lose a few sheep by having
to eat them early, but this will usually only cost about a point in scoring: a
point that is regained by the extra pasture you'll have at the end of scoring. Obviously 1F1A in exchange for 2 wood is a terrible deal. This occupation is
never playable - you're better off just taking 3 more wood.",1,https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/436563/card-card-full-review-occupations-agricola-v111,D (E-K)
13,Animal Pen,"Animal Pen Animal Pen I've seen this card hang a lot of newer players
who try to get this thing out as early as possible, no matter what their hand
is. Don't be that guy. If you have to play 2 occupations you didn't really want
to get out, it's probably not worth it because it neglects family growth. On
the other hand, if you're lucky enough to have 3 - 4 early game occupations
that you wanted to get out anyway, this play can be a backbreaker. The card gets much stronger if you are doing some
sort of drafting, as it combos almost unfairly well with the Patron, Academic
and Perpetual Student. With drafting you're also more likely to have four early
game occupations that you actually want to play.",3,https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/458895/card-card-full-review-improvements-agricola-v105,I (K) - E (C)
14,Animal Tamer,"Animal Tamer Playing him immediately gives you an extra stable and quickly becomes an extra
pasture after that (sans VPs). Usually worth it if you plan to get to 4 rooms
or more, since it lets you avoid spending precious wood and actions on early
fences/stables. Instead, you get to do what you want to do anyway - build more
rooms!",3,https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/436563/card-card-full-review-occupations-agricola-v111,D (E-K)
15,Animal Trainer,"Animal Trainer Compares hideously to the Animal Breeder. The best scenario I can think of is
waiting for the TP spot to get to 4, then taking it and making 2 boar before
the second harvest. This is probably the most easily deniable plan in the game
- as long as one of your opponents isn't an idiot, they'll take the TP spot at
3 food and make you waste the action you used to play your stupid occ. The
other possible plan - taking TP at 3 twice for 2 cattle - is also hideously
inefficient. If you're not using the occ to get animals earlier than you otherwise could,
it's worthless. You don't need an occupation to just wait for the boar spot to
get to 2 boar and take that.",1,https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/436563/card-card-full-review-occupations-agricola-v111,D (E-K)
16,Animal Yard,"Animal Yard Animal Yard Along with being a half cost pasture, the SP
attached lets you snipe a breeding pair of animals from your opponents. With a
trivial prerequisite and a cheap cost, I play this every time I get it. It's
easily one of the best improvements in the deck.",5,https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/458895/card-card-full-review-improvements-agricola-v105,I (K) - E (C)
17,Apprentice," Very strong with an aggressive Majors buying strategy. In combination with cards like Guildmaster or Manufacturer, this can give you 15 or more food. Remove Apprentice if you are playing FotM. ",3,https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/604332/stategic-review-new-g-deck-occupations,I (K)
18,Architect," Relatively weak. Unless you’re going to build at least 3 rooms and some stables, the food bonus just isn’t worth it, usually. Nice with discounters or other cards that encourage building rooms and stables. Much stronger in 2-player games. ",2,https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/604332/stategic-review-new-g-deck-occupations,G (K)

22,Axe,"Axe Axe The Axe's power varies wildly depending on the
number of players. In 2-p, it can be very awkward, since usually you have to
wait for the stone spot to appear in stage 2 before you can play it. In 3-p,
it's somewhat easier to play (you can just rawdog the crappy wildcard resource
spot), but the benefit it gives is reduced by the crushingly small amount of
reed available. In 4-p the card becomes very powerful because of the RSF spot,
and in 5-p it becomes an unquestionable 5 star card due to the 1S1W + R spot. In any case, the Axe is fantastic once you get it
out; you will usually be able to get to 4+ rooms with it. If you build 3 wooden
rooms, you are saving 8W. That's obscene.",4,https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/458895/card-card-full-review-improvements-agricola-v105,I (K) - E (C)
23,Bakehouse,"Bakehouse Bakehouse I often try to get this out if I have a clay oven.
3 VP for 3 stone is already a reasonable deal (it's more efficient than
renovation and only slightly less efficient than the Well), and you get the
most unholy powerful bake action known to man. Just keep in mind that you're
going to need other incentives to go baking; this is a nice bonus, but not
enough on its own.",3,https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/458895/card-card-full-review-improvements-agricola-v105,I (K) - E (C)
24,Baker,"Baker True to his name, this is one of the best occupations for Baking in the game.
Assuming you play him with an oven and two grain fields, you should never go
hungry. The strength of this Occ varies depending on the number of players in the game.
In a 2-p game, baking strategies are horrible. For one thing, there is no early
way to get stone. For another, there are so many animals in a 2er that you not
only want them for yourself, but want to prevent your opponent from having all
of them! In a 3-p, baking is still pretty bad due to the lack of early stone,
but often the Baker is powerful enough to merit playing him anyway. In 4-p and 5-p, baking is viable enough to make the Baker a strong incentive to
bake.",4,https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/436563/card-card-full-review-occupations-agricola-v111,B (E-G)
25,Baker’s Daughter," One of the weakest G cards, I’ve seen it go undrafted in a game where both Baker and Master Baker were passed around.

card.",3,https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/458895/card-card-full-review-improvements-agricola-v105,I (K) - E (C)
27,Baker's Oven,"Baker's Oven Baker's Oven Obviously the best of the three Baker's
improvements. You know what's better than 2VP for 2 stone? 1VP for no stone!

will always be able to play this easily, ensuring you crucial bake actions at
godly efficiency.",4,https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/458895/card-card-full-review-improvements-agricola-v105,E (C)
28,Baking Tray,"Baking Tray Baking Tray In 2-p and 3-p this card is amazing, and sometimes
enough incentive for me to go baking all by itself. Saving you the early stone
you need to get the Clay Oven is crucial, and being able to buy the oven with
SP is fantastic as well. Since no one is likely to compete with you for the
oven in 2-p and 3-p, you can plan around it. In 4-p and 5-p the value drops a bit, since
getting the early stone is less crucial. Moreover, you are more likely to have
competition for the clay oven, which makes the baking tray a riskier play
(since it tips your hand). However, in any case it is a solid improvement
that's usually worth the 1W if you plan on baking.",4,https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/458895/card-card-full-review-improvements-agricola-v105,E (C)
29,Bard," Worth comparing to Charcoal Burner, Street Magician and Puppeteer, Bard is far weaker than any of them. Against good opponents, you can expect this to pay 3 times, maybe. Only worth playing if someone drops a Traveling Players combo. ",1,https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/604332/stategic-review-new-g-deck-occupations,I (C)
30,Basin Maker,"Basin Maker This card is a joke. Not only do you have to have boar lying around for the

deal - you can do the same thing just by building a pasture!",1,https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/436563/card-card-full-review-occupations-agricola-v111,B (E-G)
31,Basket,"Basket Basket AlexFrog loves this card, saying that it is
extremely strong in a 2-p. In 2-p, he argues, reed is so important that often
it is almost correct to take 1R. From there, the game can get very hateful,
with your opponent often trying to starve you out in response to your reed
denial. This is where the Basket can really shine. 3f + 1W
is an incredible deal in 2-p, since food becomes crushingly tight in
competitive heads up play. Moreover, often you are not 'giving up'
the two wood, because you can often just take SP and then take wood again for
your first action! In other modes, the card is pretty horrible. The
increased number of players means it is less likely that you are going to have
the stacked wood get back to you. Moreover, food is much less important in the
other modes than in 2-p.",2,https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/458895/card-card-full-review-improvements-agricola-v105,I (K) - E (C)
32,Basketmaker,"Basketmaker Why are you eating your reed? That was supposed to be used for your house! Has
some utility in 5 player if the other players let the 2 reed square stack for
you (i.e. they are undervaluing reed), but in 4 player, reed is usually far too
scarce to bother with the card.",2,https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/436563/card-card-full-review-occupations-agricola-v111,B (E-G)
33,Basketmaker's Workshop,"Basketmaker's Workshop Basketmaker's Workshop My group affectionately calls this the
'Reedery.' In general, the Joinery, Pottery and Reedery are all
somewhat clunky - the early stone makes them prohibitively expensive to buy as
early sources of food, and games of Agricola usually are balanced to prevent
you from easily massing resources for the bonus points (with the exception of
clay in 5-p). However, their mere presence affects the game
tremendously, because it means that there is always always an incentive to deny your opponents from a resource
they need but you don't. While often this implicit threat is never followed up
on, the threat is always there. Although the Pottery can be very strong in larger
games, I've found the Basketmaker's Workshop to be the best overall. The extra
food per harvest is important when it comes to justifying the action used to
buy it. In 2-p, it is sometimes possible to deny your opponent reed for the
entire early game, shutting down their family growth. The Reedery is an
excellent way to actually use that reed. In 4-p, the card is helped
tremendously by the RSF spot. Just take RSF twice and you are good to go.",3,https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/458895/card-card-full-review-improvements-agricola-v105,I (K) - E (C)
34,Beanfield,"Beanfield Beanfield The prerequisite should pretty much always be met
by the time you want to plant vegetables. One VP minor improvements for no cost

genuinely useful ability makes it a must play once you've got 2 occs out.",4,https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/458895/card-card-full-review-improvements-agricola-v105,I (K) - E (C)
35,Beehive,"Beehive Beehive The prerequisite is no picnic, but sometimes my
occupations are good enough that I eventually get this guy out. When that
happens, I get about 4 food - that's pretty good for a 1 VP card that cost me
nothing. This usually isn't worth rushing, as the 2
improvement requirement should slow you down quite a bit. Also, the effect
isn't large enough to generally be worth it.",3,https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/458895/card-card-full-review-improvements-agricola-v105,I (K) - E (C)
36,Berry Picker,"Berry Picker An extremely annoying card - I've taken to calling myself 'berry-picked' in
games where someone plays this or the Mushroom Collector and spends every round
taking wood. However, this card is not quite as strong as it seems. Ultimately, it's worth
about 5 or 6 food by the end (assuming they take wood 6 or 7 times), which is
only passable given that the food is delivered over time. What makes the card
seem stronger than it actually is is that it causes newer players to value the
wood spots correctly. In 5-p, the Berry Picker can be used to spam the WSR spot, giving it added
utility.",3,https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/436563/card-card-full-review-occupations-agricola-v111,C (E-K)
37,Boar Breeding,"Boar Breeding Boar Breeding I rarely find myself comboing this card with other
boar cards to get early boar, simply because there aren't too many early boar
cards that are worth playing. This card has the most use if you are baking and
don't plan on ever taking boar. 2 VP and starting player for 1 food is a decent
deal. If you are a rancher, you're usually just spending 1 food to get 3 food -
not that great a deal.",2,https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/458895/card-card-full-review-improvements-agricola-v105,I (K) - E (C)

doesn't need to give a huge benefit to be worth it. You won't always be in a

I've seen players score higher than 60 points. Harnessing the Occ's power is no
cakewalk, but when correctly played with the right combination of cards, this
is pretty much unstoppable. I admit my rating scale breaks down a bit here - if you only look at the
percentage of time he is playable, he is probably a three star card. However, I
give the extra star simply because of his raw power - he's engineered more flat
out blowouts and unreal comebacks than any other card I can think of. The card is also easily a 5 star card in draft, where you can tailor your hand

sometimes hard to maximize the efficiency of the Sow/Bake Bread action.
Sometimes, you just want to bake bread. Unfortunately, triggering off of occupations is
undeniably awkward; by the time you actually need that baking action, you
should be in at least the third stage. By then, most of your actually good
occupations should already be on the table. Still, while it's a clunky

41,Bread Seller,"Bread Seller Pretty much worthless if only one person is baking bread, and given the
difficulty in acquiring the stone oven, this is almost always the case. One argument I've heard for him is that it turns your Cooking Hearth into an
unlimited Stone Oven. The main problem with this line of thought is that you
are going to need to be baking a LOT before the food bonus this guy gives

a good play, and even then the stone will prevent you from getting it out
anywhere close to the early game. However, if you've got something like the

In 2-p, this should give you about 4 or 5 clay if you have the right kind of
hand. Since clay is a genuinely scarce resource (see this thread this thread )
in 2-p, this is reasonably valuable. In 3-p and 4-p, the Bricklayer is very bad
- clay is plentiful enough for pretty much all of the clay related improvements
you could want. In 5-p, the value rises again - there is so much clay in the
game that clay rooms become a real possibility. In such a situation, the occ
could be worth as much as 8-9 clay over time. That's a good deal.",3,https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/436563/card-card-full-review-occupations-agricola-v111,B (E-G)

Broom and the Reed Hut are probably the closest to being actually broken. While
drawing cards clearly isn't as strong in Agricola as it is in a game like
Magic: the Gathering, the 'draw 7' vibe still harkens back to several
ridiculously overpowered cards in MtG's history. Interestingly enough, this is one of the few cards
that gets substantially weaker weaker if you employ some sort of drafting. For obvious
reasons, it's usually a good idea to play the Broom after after you've played all of the desirable improvements in your
starting hand. If you've been drafting, that should take longer than if you
started with 7 random cards. Still, even with drafting, God help the poor souls
who have to play against someone that's drawn this and the Braggart.",5,https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/458895/card-card-full-review-improvements-agricola-v105,I (K) - E (C)
46,Brush Maker,"Brush Maker If you only get 2 bonus points from this guy, he is a wasted action. You would
have been better off plowing a field! So if you play this guy, you are looking
to get the max VPs. Slaughtering 4 wild boar is a lot - you're never going to max boar if you
slaughter 4 of them. What this means is that, by sacrificing the boar to the
Brush Maker, you're not even really gaining points - you're going to lose
points for having fewer boar. Thus, the real purpose of this card is to be able
to slaughter boar for food without having to worry about losing points for not
having them. But if food is your priority, what are you doing wasting a food
and an action? Furthermore, cards you need to play early that eventually grant VPs are
fundamentally weak in Agricola. They need to be played when you need actions
the most and then give you nothing until the end of the game - not a good idea
when your actions are supposed to have a snowballing effect.",1,https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/436563/card-card-full-review-occupations-agricola-v111,B (E-G)

that you can't play a major improvement along the way further reduces the
card's efficiency. Sometimes you'll look at your hand after you FG and have
nothing better to play, but you're not losing much value by just keeping it in
your hand. The value of the card goes up, however, if you
plan on playing an occupation that requires you to renovate to clay quickly.

the fact that it looks looks so bad means that the person you pass it to is less
likely to take SP with it any time in the near future. Like all the 'pass to the left' cards,
however, this can be a bit pointless in 2-p. Sometimes your opponent will
simply retake SP with it and get pretty much an identical benefit, leaving you

51,Businessman,"Businessman The main draw of the SP + 1 minor improvement space is seldom the minor
improvement, but the fact that you get starting player. Playing 2 minor
improvements effectively decreases the number of times you can take starting
player by 1, which is often a bad idea. However, sometimes you will have a very
strong hand of minor improvements, and will want to get them out as fast as
possible. The main appeal comes if in the major improvement clause. Getting a major
improvement along with your minor will often save you a full action!
Particularly if you've got a strong hand of minors to go with him, this can
make the Businessman extremely efficient. Generally, this occ will be most powerful in large games, where Cooking Hearths
are limited and often there is a scramble to get them. This guy can help you
win that race, first by getting an early sheep-eating fireplace without having
to depend on the Major improvement spot coming out, and second by giving you a

Collector, which does the same thing multiple times per harvest. One interesting difference between the two is that with the Cabinet Maker, the
wood you convert to food is vaporized, whereas the Mushroom Collector leaves it
behind for someone else to take. This is actually a downside, as if you're

58,Carpenter,"Carpenter If you build 3 rooms before renovating, he's worth 6 conditional wood - an OK
but not fantastic deal given that the wood is delivered over time and that
you're forced to use it on a specific thing. Given how rarely people actually
build 3 rooms in the first place (usually reed is too scarce), this won't come
up too often. If you only build two rooms, 4 wood for 1F1A is ok, I guess. However, the
4/3/2/1 wood occupations all give 4 wood the moment you play them, not just
when you build your 4th room (which, depending on how the game is going, might
take a while). Furthermore, the wood those occs give is no strings attached -
you're not required to use it to build rooms. In my experience all of the
4/3/2/1 occs are playable, but they're by no means must-plays. Since the
Carpenter is almost strictly worse if you're only building 2 rooms, he's
probably not worth it in that case. It's true that he can be used to reduce the cost of clay rooms and stone rooms
as well as Wooden Rooms. However, I think clay and stone rooms are mostly a
corner case - most rooms are wood, a few are clay, and almost none are stone
(the Well tends to be a much more efficient way to get points). Moreover, in
cases where you actually want to build clay rooms, clay is probably common enough

it's by plowing fields or taking singleton animals to stay in your home. Overall, the high occupation requirement, zero VPs

(and thus indirectly indirectly feeding clay to
your opponents, rather than directly), you're going to have to still take the
other clay spots as much as you usually would. This will result in you having
way more clay than you usually would want, and it might be difficult to find a
reasonable use for it. Most likely it will be in the form of clay rooms, but it

the single 'sow/bake' spot can be a huge weakness, as that space

someone who renovates fairly and someone who uses the Conservator and then
spends an action on the Major/Minor Improvement space. The 'fair' player: Spends 2 actions renovating Spends about 1 action collecting 3-5 clay Spends about 1/2 of an action collecting 1 reed The Conservator: Spends 1 action playing the Conservator Spends 1 action renovating Spends 1 action playing major/minor improvement Even in this case the Conservator is better (he saves about half an action).
However, the Conservator has 2 additional benefits on top of that: 1) You don't have to buy the Major improvement if there is a more efficient way
of gaining points. For instance, rather than spending 1A on 3 stone and 1A on
Major/Minor to get a well, you can just plow 2 fields. 2) You can wait until much later to renovate. Because of the limited number of
renovation spots, the 'fair' player needs to renovate to clay fairly
early if he wants to get to stone. That means he also has to collect clay and
reed fairly early. The Conservator can just wait until the last possible
moment. I have played this card literally every time I've gotten him, and I'm pretty
sure I've never made a mistake in doing so. In competitive games where
resources are tight, he has singlehandedly won me the game by ensuring me a
stone renovation that otherwise would have been impossible. That's a good sign

ranchers take a grain without using an action. I lean towards the opinion that this guy is pretty strong and better than the
Master Brewer. Paying 2 food for 1 grain is never that great of a deal, even
later in the game. Moreover, while the food he delivers is a tad unreliable, he
should be able to consistently convert your grain to 3 food in the early and
mid game, when you need food the most. Still, like the Master Brewer, you're going to need a grain source for this guy

strategy. If you're trying to get two grain fields sown it will save you an
action, and it can also be used to forgo the need for two grain fields entirely
- just take grain again when you run out. The main reason this isn't a five star card is
that it's pretty lame when you choose not to buy an oven. Maybe you have animal
yard and sheep farmer in your hand. What then? If all of your cards point to
animals and you have the corn scoop, are you really just going to ignore the

you're not planning on using the early grain, don't play this early! The card
is popular enough that it will quickly get passed around after that, and your
opponents will get at least as much benefit as you did. Like all of the
'pass' cards, the fact that you have to pass this to your lefthand
opponent hurts, as he or she is the person that you least want to take SP. That said, this is still an excellent card
provided that you make sure you are breaking its inherent symmetry. Either use
it early so that you can get a grain engine going, or wait till one of the
final rounds to ensure that your opponents don't have much time to use it, then
eliminate a negative. The card's value also increases if your opponents have
already taken grain; the second grain isn't nearly as valuable as the first.",3,https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/458895/card-card-full-review-improvements-agricola-v105,I (K) - E (C)

to a Drinking Trough until you have at least 2 pastures. This is a significant
weakness, since early pastures are usually a bad deal. The reason for this is
that if you compare a single pasture to 2 stables, you can hold the same amount
of animals, but the stables can be built as a 'free' action when you
build rooms. The pasture, on the other hand, requires a full action on its own. That said, the Drinking Trough is still very
efficient at increasing your animal capacity once you have a couple of small
pastures up. While the improvement is often a mistake to play early, it can be
a nice play in the mid to late game if you haven't built stables yet.",3,https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/458895/card-card-full-review-improvements-agricola-v105,I (K) - E (C)

but this is definitely a niche ability. Veggies are worth 1 VP each, and
animals after your first one are always less than 1 VP. This means that a lot
of the time this is just not a good deal. There's also the awkwardness involved
with having plentiful veggies AND fences with animals in them (but not too many
animals!) - an uncommon situation to find yourself in, barring unusual
circumstances. The best use of this improvement is when an
occupation like the Undergardener has given you a ton of veggies. Since you're
probably going to easily max veggies, it can be nice to convert your excess
crops into some extra victory points. The card can also be a clunky way to get
a breeding pair of cattle - just take cattle at 1 and then trade in your veggie. Usually, this will have a marginal benefit, at
best. Still, it's hard to argue with the price-tag.",2,https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/458895/card-card-full-review-improvements-agricola-v105,I (K) - E (C)

way to break the inherent symmetry of the card for this to be worth playing. If
you plan on actually using the field to grow crops, then it's usually a good

'Plow and Sow' actions, which is an undeniably strong spot. However, he's even
stronger than that. In the final round of the game, he ensures that you can
plow before before you plow and sow. This is always the

being purchased. Moreover, since 3-p can only really support 1 baker, the card
only tends to deliver the full amount of grain when you aren't baking, making
the grain a marginal addition to your farm. In a 4 or 5 player game, buying one of the two Cooking Hearths basically forces
someone else to begin sowing. Still, you're only getting one food each time,

126,Fireplace,"Fireplace Fireplace There are two things that drive the early game:
the battle for 5W and 2R, and the fight for the early fireplace. Winning the
fireplace race is a boon, as it can singlehandedly ensure a windfall of early
game mutton. Your opponents will be forced to watch the sheep pile up, knowing
that the moment they make a move towards acquiring them, you will snatch them
up. And so, oftentimes, no one no one will do anything toward acquiring them, instead
fighting amongst each other for other early game sources of food. And the sheep
will continue to build up, doomed to eventually be cooked in your kitchen. There are two things to be careful of. The first
is that occasionally someone to your left will take SP, inadvertently giving
one of your right-hand opponents a 2-action window to build fences/cookery and
then snatch them up. The second is if an opponent has one of the few
improvement cards that can break your choke-hold (Animal Yard and Simple
Fireplace are both good examples). As such, the early fireplace is an interesting
exercise in risk assessment. The longer you wait, the bigger the reward, but
the greater chance that the game's inherently chaotic nature will let your
sheep escape to someone else's farm. In most games, the 3-clay fireplace is usually not
worth the buy. The main power of the fireplace is not for its late-game staying
power (barring strange games where you manage to only feed on sheep, you will
usually want to upgrade to a Cooking Hearth), but for its strategic early game
value. The exception to this is 2-p games, where clay is tight enough to make a
4-clay grab pretty much a pipe dream. Moreover, animals are tight enough that
if you don't eventually buy some animal cookery in a heads up match, your
opponent will become flooded with readily available food. If you find yourself with a fireplace, it's often
worth making the upgrade to a Cooking Hearth. However, there are certainly
times when secondary food sources like the Well will be able to let you subsist
entirely on sheep. The three clay fireplace is a three star card,
while the two clay fireplace is easily a five star card. The rating below

improvements should be fairly rare. Even if one gets played, it's not too bad
because that player is less likely to take the Fishing spot from you to deny
you food. As a whole, this card works best when played with semi-experienced players.
Good players tend to avoid the fishing spot unless it gets to 4 or even more,
but will adjust to deny you the food if you let the spot get too high. Newer
players that struggle with feeding their family will take it when it's at 3 or
even 2. As a result, the presence of even one newbie can hurt this occ a lot.
The sweet spot is a group of players who are right in between: they can feed
their family reasonably well without resorting to fishing, but aren't too
concerned with what you're doing. That said, the ability to get 6 or even 8 food with a single action is amazing,
especially if this happens early. Just make sure you don't get too greedy;

be times later on where all you want to do is bake bread. In those situations,
this card can increase your efficiency, as plowing is pretty much always a good
action, whereas sowing requires empty fields. Unfortunately, this card suffers from the same
problem that the Builder's Trowel has - since you had to spend a half action
and a wood playing it, it doesn't really save you an action. Moreover, often
extra bake bread actions are unnecessary even when you're baking. However, the value of the the card definitely goes
up as you increase the number of players in the game. In 4-p and 5-p, it's not
uncommon to get blocked from the sow/bake spot, and this can be a great way

136,Foreman,"Foreman A fascinating card. In order to get the most out of this occ, you are going to
need play well. The first step is taking starting player more than anyone else
(usually a good idea anyway). When you are SP, the Foreman is a no fuss 1 food,
which gets pretty powerful when you get one every round. Things get hairier when someone takes SP from you. At this stage, you're going
to need to see if there's an action that only you can take (build rooms, sow
and family growth are the most common ones). If not, bring on the AP, because
there is going to be a lot to consider when choosing where to place your food.
The first step is predicting what the players in front of you are going to do.
The second step is predicting how adding a food to each relevant square will
change what they do. The third step is figuring out how all this benefits you.
The complexities quickly become mind-boggling, and could probably be used to
make some fiendish puzzles. Still, if you can consistently get the food every turn or at least use the food
to get a square you otherwise couldn't have had, he is well worth bringing out
in the first round in a 4-p game. In 5-p, his utility goes down a bit.",3,https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/436563/card-card-full-review-occupations-agricola-v111,G (I-K)

a boon in the small subset of games that it's useful. If you have been cut off

138,Forester,"Forester The card is a trap: it requires considerable setup, and then doesn't give a
suitably large payoff. In order to get the most out of the card, you're going
to need to play him and sow in Stage 1. The reason for this is that you cannot
afford to loan him 3 wood in stage 2, since you need to be building rooms for
family growth then. By stage 3, the extra wood will probably be coming in too
late to be relevant. So let's say you set out to play him in stage 1. You're going to need to take
wood (never a problem), play him, and sow. But wait! If you're only using the
sow to plant your 3 wood, you're using your actions inefficiently. Just compare
taking 3 wood three times to playing him, taking three wood and sowing. One
gives you the wood now and denies your opponents, the other gives the wood much
later and lets your opponents have free reign. So in order to make the card
more efficient, you're going to need to sow something else. This is a minimum
of 2 more actions. Devoting so many actions to this plan ahead of time
restricts your ability to adapt to your opponents. If the starting player
inexplicably passes on 2 reed, for instance, you're going to have to let it go
by as well, instead spending one of your actions to further develop your cute
little wood engine. The card is also limited by the number of harvests (6). You're never going to
be able to sow wood on this more than twice. One neat trick is that the wood remaining on the card at the end of the game
counts towards the Joinery, even if you haven't harvested yet. As a result, you
shouldn't be too worried about getting more wood on the card after all of the
wood comes off the second time - just keep the wood until you plow and sow, and
you'll have 9 wood ready to be converted to 3 VP at the end of the game. Bottom line: this card requires a lot of work to be clearly better than just
taking more wood.",2,https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/436563/card-card-full-review-occupations-agricola-v111,D (E-K)

potential reward here that it can even be worth rushing out in the midgame. While most 3 occ improvements are conditional on
you having good occupations, this gets the extra star simply because its effect
is usually tempting enough to get it out even if one of my occupations is a

completely as a powerful food source that usually comes a bit too late in the

good spots off of the board. As a result, the value that his action gives you

usually too tricky to be worth the effort, and being forced to make an extra
resource grab or two just to play this can severely cut down on the card's VP

162,Harrow,"Harrow Harrow Is 2W and an action worth a field, assuming you
were taking SP anyway? In most cases the answer is probably yes, but not if you
have anything better to play. An interesting question is whether the second
clause on the card is an 'ability' or not. In 2-p it is clearly not;
your opponent should only be making the trade if she thinks it benefits her
more than it benefits you. However, in 4-p and 5-p, cooperation and trading
become much more viable from a game-theory standpoint. Chances are that there
will be times where paying you the food for the extra plow will be mutually
beneficial to both parties. In 2-p and 3-p games, this is usually a dubious
play, at best. The benefit it gives you is pretty small, and it has a chance of
giving your opponents a 'free' plow if food ends up being plentiful
in the game. In 4-p and 5-p, food is usually plentiful enough that you can
expect everyone to use it eventually. This will give you a ton of food, but
most of it will come in the late game. However, you probably won't end up on
fields.",3,https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/458895/card-card-full-review-improvements-agricola-v105,I (K) - E (C)

else is baking bread, you won't want to compete with them and all the grain you
take will just end up sitting in your personal supply. If you're baking bread,
no one else will be and he won't get any grain. In 4-p and 5-p he becomes much better, since the game is more likely to support
2 bakers. No matter how many players are in the game, if you can get him out

times.",3,https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/436563/card-card-full-review-occupations-agricola-v111,B (E-G)
164,Head of the Family,"Head of the Family In 4-p games, Head of the Family is amazing. With 4 players competing for the
Build Room(s) and FG spots, people get edged out a good deal. Oftentimes
someone will take SP just to ensure an early FG in the next round. Combined
with the ability to take FG w/o room as your last action one or two times in
the end game, he is almost a must play regardless of the rest of your hand. In 5-p games, his utility decreases - with 2 FG spots and 2 build room spots,
you are once again unlikely to get blocked. While he does help you get the
'good' Build Room and FG spots, the chance to buy a stable or some
random minor improvement isn't usually that essential. A key weakness of this occ is that while you won't ever get blocked from the
relevant spots, you also will tend to refrain from blocking anyone else. The

weaknesses. Aside from the steep food cost, this card will always look better
on bad player's farms than yours. Weaker players tend to neglect early family
growth, putting them behind on farm development and ahead on food. If you have
been playing well, you might only have 2 or 3 unused spaces, and won't have
much food to spare. Still, if you have at least 3 unused spaces and plenty of food, he'll always be
worth the action. Potentially amazing if you are able to focus on Improvements
for points and then use him at the end of the game for 5+ VPs. If I ever break

the Potato Dibber before you can start eating vegetables reliably. In that

as your main source of food. Nonetheless, this guy is usually worth playing simply because the free sow is
usually worth 1 food, and you were going to spend an action taking a vegetable

184,Juggler,"Juggler As a note, playing one of the Traveling Players cards after someone has played
the Juggler is usually a terrible play. Because every Traveling Players card
needs to take the space to work properly, you are competing with whoever played
the Juggler - always a bad idea in games with more than 2 players. Competing
means two things: 1) your own Occupation's ability will be less useful, and 2)
the person who played the Juggler will take TP less. The question when deciding whether to play this card, then, is whether you
think the people you play with will recognize this fact. Often they won't and
will gleefully play their TP occ, not realizing that they're screwing
themselves just as much as they're screwing you. The exceptions to this are the
dancer and puppeteer, which can really wreck the Juggler's day. Early on the
Dancer takes TP a lot, preventing the square from building up. Later, when the
Dancer's ability isn't as impressive, the Dancer will stop taking TP in the
hopes that the Juggler will deliver 1 or 2 extra food. The puppeteer wants
other people to take TP, and the Juggler guarantees that TP will be taken
often. For him, the extra food is just an added bonus to something he probably
wanted to do anyway. As far as comparing him to the fisherman, there are more TP occs than Fisherman
improvements, which reduces his value somewhat. However, smart players should
be less inclined to play some of the TP cards after you've brought the Juggler
out, and Occupations are usually harder to play than minor improvements. It's
pretty much a wash.",3,https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/436563/card-card-full-review-occupations-agricola-v111,G (I-K)
185,Ladder,"Ladder Ladder Obviously this is great if you happen to have the
Half-Timbered House or the Chicken Coop, as both improvements become very
strong when their reed cost is negated. Unfortunately, most of the other
improvements listed are pretty horrible, and probably aren't worth the effort
even with the reduced reed cost. Thank Rosenberg that this doesn't reduce the
Reed Hut's cost. As a whole, the main benefit is going to be the
free renovations and discounted rooms. At the end of the day, this can save you
4-5 reed, which is a pretty sweet deal for 2W. Still, the steep wood cost hurts
when you consider that this needs to be played early to be worth it.",3,https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/458895/card-card-full-review-improvements-agricola-v105,I (K) - E (C)
186,Land Agent,"Land Agent This is the worst early vegetable card. When you get the early vegetable,
you're going to want to sow it. However, sowing just 1 vegetable is usually a
bad deal, so you'll probably take a grain and plow 2 fields before you sow.
Then, when the 'Take one Vegetable' space appears, you'll look at your 4
vegetables and your sown grain and wonder why you would ever want 1 more of
either. Has some use in that sometimes you just need to get your 4th occ, and paying
1F1A for an early vegetable is only somewhat of a raw deal.",3,https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/436563/card-card-full-review-occupations-agricola-v111,H (K-E)

but its use changes drastically. In 2-p and 3-p, the primary use will be to try
to starve your opponents out of reed by taking it at 1 every round. While there
are some counters to this strategy (Clay Roof, Reed Exchange, etc), a lot of
the time your opponents are going to be unable to grow their family. This can
turn into a soul-crushing advantage in the mid-game. In 4-p and 5-p, the use will morph into using the
early reed taken from RSF or RSW to get a powerful mini-food engine going on
those same spots.",5,https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/458895/card-card-full-review-improvements-agricola-v105,I (K) - E (C)
188,Lasso,"Lasso Lasso This card is almost unplayable in 2-p and 3-p. In
2-p animals are very easy to get, so they are seldom a premium spot. In 3-p,
reed is so scarce that often you can't spare even one without spending a full
additional action to acquire it. However, in 4-p and 5-p, when animals are much
scarcer per player, the animal spot is often a great spot. Moreover, reed is
easier to get. In these games, the Lasso is amazingly strong and arguably one
of the best improvements you could hope to draw.",3,https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/458895/card-card-full-review-improvements-agricola-v105,I (K) - E (C)

190,Late Sleeper," The strongest G-deck card, Late Sleeper exchanges an extra action every round for last choice of actions.

round, this can save you 9 food with no penalty if you don't have any relevant
animal reproductions. I don't need to tell you that that is a great deal. Another solid use is to use the card before the 1st or 2nd harvests. If you've
been aggressively pursuing FG (and you should be!), you often won't have
anything relevant to actually harvest, making the Occ all upside. In that
sense, the card can sort of work like a Mendicant that you have to play early -
this won't always be great, but sometimes can be very strong, especially if
your opponents are working to deny you food. This will always be a conditional card, but in certain cases can be extremely
powerful - even game-breaking. He gains in value if your opponents are strong

this is well worth the wood if you plan on getting lots of the relevant animal.
Still, this isn't quite as strong as the Milking Stool simply because it costs
2W and not 1. Since fencing for early sheep already requires a lot of early
wood, the cost can be surprisingly tight when combined with the 5W you need for

specific areas, and instead rewards last-minute diversification. As a result
you generally won't have much incentive for maxing areas with the intention of
getting points on this guy, because you could probably be getting just as many
points by filling in negatives. That said, you only really need 3 areas maxed for him to be worth the action.

196,Lover,"Lover Extra cost: 4 food Ah, the infamous lover. Certainly, in reports like this tournament thread tournament thread ,
he seems to be unfair. In the game, a player plays turn 2 lover and is able to
seemingly coast to victory. Without a doubt, the Lover is one of the best
occupations in the game. But is he broken? Playing the lover is pretty much impossible on round 1, so by 'early lover
action,' people generally mean rounds 2, 3 or 4, with the most infamous starts
coming in round 2. If you play it round 2, you're going to need to take
day-laborer once just to play it. Afterwards, you'll have either 1 or 0 food
and will need to secure 6 food by the end of the harvest. This should take at
least 2 more actions. What does this mean? You've spent 4 actions to get 2
actions before the first harvest! Another weakness with the Early Lover is that his house is still 2 rooms! A
player who grows his family the old fashioned way has the option of building a
4th room to his house and growing again. On the other hand, the Early Lover is
stuck with his 2 room house - he's going to need 10 wood and 4 reed before he
can grow his family again. If he decides to eschew further 'fair' family growth
and wait for 'Family Growth without Room,' he suffers from the fact that his 2
room house is pretty much unsuitable for renovation - there just won't be many
points in it. The final weakness is that playing the Lover early puts a giant bulls-eye on
your head. If your opponents are strong, they will be looking to screw you out
of food at every possible avenue. That said, what makes the Early Lover strong is that while he is scrambling for
food, he is also using his extra actions to take resources off of the board.
The result is that while his farm might not look all that impressive, no one
else's will either! Pretty much everyone will be gimped by the Lover's
inefficient scrambling, and by the end the Lover himself usually comes out
ahead. Playing the Lover on turn 2 is an all-in play - you are either going to win
because of the play or lose because of it. An interesting alternative is to
forgo playing him until around stage 3. Usually by this time, you have grown
your family once and have some sort of a food engine up. Hopefully, you can
then grab either 3 sheep or a piled fishing spot and use it to play the card.
Used this way, the Lover is safer and still a strong play, but doesn't have the
swingy potential that playing him early does.",5,https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/436563/card-card-full-review-occupations-agricola-v111,G (I-K)

1S for 3W is pretty efficient. In 2-p, stone is fairly plentiful and wood (like
always) is not, making it a good late game play (your opponent won't usually be
able to use it himself). In 4-p, this is a great way to use the excess stone
you got from the RSF spot - stone is an inherently late game resource, so being
able to efficiently trade it for an early-game one can be helpful.",3,https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/458895/card-card-full-review-improvements-agricola-v105,I (K) - E (C)

despite being a card that gives VP for no cost! Most of the time, you simply
won't have two improvements that aren't worth VP sitting around. Instead,
you'll usually have to chuck a 1VP improvement along with a no VP improvement,

particularly in games where clay is tight enough to make clay rooms unfeasible.
1 food a round is nice, but you're never going to be able to abuse this card
too much. Once you get to 3 rooms, you might want to go for a renovation in
stage 3. If you play her by the end of round 9, she'll be worth 4 food (5 food
minus the one you took to play him). That's ok, but not worth the effort of

201,Manger,"Manger Manger This card has awkwardness written all over it. In
general, I dislike cards that force me to play differently to get their
benefit. I want cards that reward me for playing the way I would have normally,
which is to get a 3-4 room stone house, 3-5 fields plowed and a 6 space set of
3-4 pastures. In this case, however, the 4VP bonus is often too much to pass up. 1 point is not worth 2W, so you're never playing
this with the intention of 6 spaces worth of pastures. Furthermore, there's no
non-idiotic setup that lets you fence 7 pastures. Try it; it just doesn't work.
So if you play the Manger, it's with the intention of going all-in and fencing
8 or 9 spaces. This strategy requires a ton of wood that you're
usually not guaranteed to have by the end of the game, so it can be risky.
Whether you're fencing 8 or 9 spaces, you need a minimum minimum 14 wood - 12 to fence either a 3x3 or 4x2
square, and 2 to play the manger. This card becomes difficult to use if you are
trying to breed animals early, since you can't build a mid-sized pasture
without running out of fences. So you will usually be playing this card when
you are either baking or have some other alternate source of food. However, all of this effort and commitment to this
card leads to 3 or 4 points for 2W. This is undeniably efficient. The fact that
you aren't spending much more effort on your farm (you will probably only have
2 or 3 fields) frees up actions to buy VP improvements.",4,https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/458895/card-card-full-review-improvements-agricola-v105,I (K) - E (C)
202,Manservant,"Manservant Due to the lack of relevant resources in 2-p and 3-p, it is usually very
difficult to renovate early enough to make the Manservant worth it. In 5-p and to a lesser extent 4-p, however, clay is abundant enough that
renovating to clay and then building rooms becomes a genuine option. From
there, acquiring the stone for the second renovation is not too much out of the
way. In that environment, the Manservant can be good and even game-breaking,
depending on just how early you can get him out.",3,https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/436563/card-card-full-review-occupations-agricola-v111,G (I-K)

manage to get this out with a four room stone house. If you look at the cost,
3W, 3C, 2R, and 3S are all hefty enough amounts to represent a full action to
collect, so you will have spent at least 4 moves to score those 8 points. For
all the effort involved, that's hardly impressive. You probably could have used
those moves elsewhere to score points just as efficiently, with less risk of
your massive plan falling through. The only time when this is really worth playing is
when you have a card that enables you to cheaply build rooms. If you are able
to get to 5 or even 6 rooms, playing the Mansion goes from being a wildly
inefficient powerplay to an absolute blowout. This won't happen very often, but

easy to get them once you've played this Occ. This is sort of a pet card of
mine - if I plan on getting a resource major, I usually play him and pick up
another one later. The fact that you can grab starting player when you buy the
resource majors with him is a nice bonus to the 4-6 stone he basically gives.

to pick one or the other in order to feed yourself. This makes the Manure of
dubious value; either you'll be herding animals and won't have any crops, or
you'll be concentrating on crops and won't have the infrastructure built to
hold two animals! While this eventually changes near the end of the
game, by then most of the rounds are going to be ending in harvests anyway.

single sowed grain field can be a nice secondary food source to tide you over
while you set yourself up for family growth and a more robust food engine. His usefulness is limited, however, by the fact that you need to be sowing
grain in the early game to use him. This isn't always the best path to go, as

grain sowing over FG and early fireplace (which, barring cards, are the

218,Mendicant,"Mendicant I still think that the only time that the mendicant gives any sort of
substantial benefit is if the action you take as an alternative allows you to
take an accrued resource, get family growth a turn earlier, or provides some
benefit not usually available. The idea behind the Mendicant, it is being proposed, is that it will
give not only one, but likely all of these things, simply by merit of the fact
that it allows one to advance play by an entire action and, thus, an entire
round. The disconnect between this proposed concept and your interpretation
thereof seems to be a disjoin between the abstract and the demonstrable. Usually, when speaking of choices in this game, it's practical, or at least
feasible, to reference what's been gained based on a choice. Building early
stables, for example, lets you breed sheep for food. Double plow and sow before
the first harvest can get an early grain engine going. And so forth. In this
situation, however, it's counterintuitive to be specific when speaking about
the Mendicant and what benefit, direct or indirect, it may or may not offer if
its 'food loan' is exercised. The Mendicant's loan does not offer sheep or
family growth, per say. Instead, abstractly, it offers pace pace . Pace is the most precious resource in Agricola. It is amorphous, undefined. Yet
it undeniably exists, and exerts its influence upon every round, upon every
action, from start of game to end. Pace largely (though not entirely!)
determines who gets their food engine going sooner, who gets their house
enlarged sooner, who gets their family grown sooner. It determines who has time
to spare to gather particular, specific resources and who does not. It
determines who has time to fiddle with Start Player due to a surplus of pace;
or, it determines who is compelled to fiddle with Start Player to accommodate
for a lack of it. In a passive-interaction, economic competition game, pace is
king. The Mendicant is unique insofar as it offers an opportunity that no other card
does. It gives the player a choice, a meta-game choice, to decide to gain gain early game pace at the expense of
(presumably) late-game pace. It offers this power just by merit of sitting in
the owner's hand; the option is exercised first, the cost (i.e., putting out
the card) is paid later. In your observation, you critique the player for choosing not to eat his grain
and vegetable, by merit of the supposition that he could simply replace them in
the next round. The counterpoint is that by exercising the Mendicant option, he
didn't have to take the time to replace the grain and vegetable. Instead, he
immediately went on to the next step in his plan, which was to use these
resources to launch his food engine. He advanced along his intended strategic
path, rather than repeating or, worse, regressing upon it. He gained pace. 
Perhaps in fact he merely gained a single action. But this single action can be
crucial, critical. Surely you have played often enough to have a fireplace
snatched from your fingertips, to have animals slaughtered in someone else's
kitchen rather than your own, to be ready to enlarge your home or grow your
family only to see yourself unable to do so for want of a single, extra action
ahead of an opponent's. Now instead think upon the games wherein your position
was well enough laid out, your pace ever so slightly ahead of the pack, that it
was you, and not them, who got that first family growth, forcing them to wait
another round to grow theirs whilst you enjoyed the fruits of your labor. The
Mendicant in your hand helps you to ensure the latter to occur more often than
the former. And the effective is cumulative, arguably. The Mendicant saves us an action,
inherently -- the action of collecting two food. Instead, that action is spent
on something more beneficial to short-term strategy, such as collecting reed or
wood for building a home extension. This in turn could lead us to growing our
family one round earlier than we would have otherwise been able to. By growing
our family one round early, we've now gained *another* action. That action,
too, sets our pace forward more rapidly, eventually letting us again expand our
home and grow our family earlier, netting us still yet another action. Pace is
self-perpetuating; it is exponential in its rewards. And the earlier the seed,
the more bountiful the harvest. And all of this pace acceleration has a strong, I would even argue devastating,
effect on the rest of the players. The extra action(s) you gained can be used
to gather pace-related resources. More resources for you means less for them;
even snatching a simple stack of 3 wood is enough to ruin another player's
plans of family growth for who knows how long. Whereas, the players who have to
scrounge around on the Day Laborer space are simply leaving those resources
around for others to take. That's an enormous swing in the early game. Indeed: it was just this sort of swing that spawned the discussion from which
this thread emerged. Someone expended their 'extra' Mendicant action to take
the sheep away from another player. That player's game was devastated. That
player (a) had to waste his last action; (b) still took a horrid amount of
begging negatives; and (c) now *still* has to scrounge around for sheep to get
his food engine going for the next harvest. His pace was shredded. The
Mendicant holder's pace was hardly affected. That's an amazing boon. That said, the Mendicant is hardly a powerhouse. You're not going to
want to play this every time - just when a very juicy opportunity presents
itself. Moreover, a smart player is going to see you take those 2 begging cards
and immediately know that you plan on Mendicant'ing your way out. Especially if
you're in 2-p, she might then try to block the occupation square in the last

underrate this plow, which might have something to do with the fact that it has
'mold' in its name (ewww!). Still, think of it this way: if you value
plowing a field at one action and 2W at a little less than one action (3W for 1
action is usually the default), this is a good trade if you have nothing better
to do with your SP/FG. The lack of any prerequisites and somewhat useful effect
sometimes make it worth the effect. If you get two extra fields, the card becomes

often than usual, which balances out the wood you have to leave behind. Mushroom Collector can be risky in 2-p. Because he leaves behind a wood, your

Animal Breeder. POW! 3 fields for one action. Take that, Crooked Plow! However, when you're not in magical Christmas land
where you've acquired cattle earlier than you should, the card becomes awkward.
If your plan is to acquire cattle fairly, there are two problems. First, you're
going to have to fight the other players for them (2 cattle is a premium spot
in just about any Agricola game). Second, half the time cattle are going to

sort of drafting. I initially disliked this guy a lot because of his inherent randomness, but he
has grown on me over time. The key here is to think of him as a food-engine,
and not just a random occupation generator. Day-Laborer + any effect is pretty
strong (see: Seasonal Worker), and a random occupation is no exception. I still don't like him for the somewhat common case where you have one or two
excellent occupations and a bunch of crap. However, if you have a bunch of
mediocre occupations and this guy, he can be very strong, particularly with

243,Philip Eve,"Philip Eve @Hammerite Let us suppose that I manage to have the maximum of 3 offspring, and
that I play Adoptive Parents before I have played the first of these. (If this
is not the case, then Adoptive Parents decreases in usefulness.) Immediately after playing the card, I have lost 1 food and 1 action. Immediately after having my first offspring (and using Adoptive Parents for the
first time), I have lost two food and I have not lost any actions. (I lost one
action by using it to play the card, but I gained an extra action for this
round, so I have neither lost nor gained actions.) Immediately after having my second offspring (and using Adoptive Parents for
the second time), I have lost 3 food and I have gained one action (namely, the
extra action I will get this round). Immediately after having my third offspring (and using Adoptive Parents for the
third time), I have lost 4 food and I have gained 2 actions (the one I gained
on my second use of the card, and the extra action I will get this round). Hence, overall I pay 4 food for 2 actions. However, the reasoning is flawed by the fact that not all actions are
created equally. Adoptive parents gives you another action after you have already played your initial actions after you have already played your initial actions . By
that time, there will be rarely anything left that is worth taking, and you may
honestly find yourself taking Day Laborer or something not much better. Also, 2 food for 1 action is a pretty steep cost to begin with (you only pay
that much for actions in the final round). Furthermore, Agricola is an
exponential game and your early actions are worth more than your later actions,
and playing an early card that will result in only marginally above break-even

the Grocer gives often makes the 1F cost too steep. This occ can have a lot of utility, however, to use to abuse the RSF spot. 1
reed 2 stone or 2 reed 1 stone are both very strong plays, and possibly an even

won't actually be profiting from the card until you use the Joinery 3 times. If

has a powerful effect, potentially giving upwards of 4 grain and 2 veggies if
used aggressively. A lot of people cross their eyes at the phrase
'orthogonally adjacent' and immediately assume that the card is more
trouble than it's worth, but honestly it's not too hard to get 2 or 3 fields
plowed next to your house. The main issue is timing the card properly. The two
occ requirement limits the card's use to the midgame, where getting a bunch of
grain sown is less desirable. However, even if you can't exactly rush it out
early, the extra veggies alone often make the card too good to pass up. If you
plant a grain and a veggie with it out, the card has probably scored you two
points. That's an excellent deal for a free card. If you're planning on sowing
a lot, this is usually worth it.",4,https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/458895/card-card-full-review-improvements-agricola-v105,I (K) - E (C)

5 fields, you're going to need 4 actions (1 to play the Occ, 3 to plow) and 3
food (1 to play the Occ, 2 to plow). This is not appreciably better than just
plowing a field 5 times, since the 3 food he costs will probably take another

worth 1VP - that's already a decent deal for 1W. If you plan on sowing
vegetables more than once, it becomes worth 2 or more points and a great deal.
Since nearly every good endgame strategy involves sowing vegetables at least
once, this is usually worth playing. Don't get me started on how silly this
card becomes if you have an occupation that provides early vegetables. The card is interesting to compare to the
Planter's Box. On one hand the Planter's Box is clearly a stronger and cheaper
card. However, Potato Dibber can be played in the early game, and being able to
play Dibber to set up an early 2R grab can be crucial. The fact that the two
improvements are roughly equal in my book speaks volumes for how much timing

258,Private Forest,"Private Forest Private Forest A deceptively weak card. While it looks amazing on
paper, there are two problems with it. The first is that the 2 food cost is
substantial when the card pretty much has has to be played in stage 1 to be any good. Second, while 7
wood sounds like a lot, the fact that the wood is taken from the supply rather
than off the board makes it considerably less valuable, since it doesn't deny
your opponents. Finally, wood reduces in value of the course of the game, so
that by the final round it's not worth nearly as much as it was in stage 1. Often, the food cost implies that you will have to
spend an extra action gathering food in stage 1.If you compare playing Private
Forest and then taking Day Laborer to just taking 3 Wood twice, the latter is
clearly superior. I'd rather have 6 wood now and deny my opponents in the
process than receive 7 wood in the distant future. As a result, if I want to take SP in Round 1 and I
have this card, I'll go ahead play it (the fact that it doesn't require any
non-food resources to play is nice early). However, if someone else takes SP
and I miss my 1 round window, I'm not too fussed about leaving it in my hand.",2,https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/458895/card-card-full-review-improvements-agricola-v105,I (K) - E (C)

commits you to not taking the TP square in hopes that other people will take
it. Furthermore, you will never be sure exactly when someone will take TP,
making it hard to maximize the efficiency of your actions. Since the last time
TP is taken is usually quite late, you're going to need at least one late-game
VP occ that you don't care about when it comes out (Chief's Daughter,
Mendicant, etc.). Still, since TP is usually taken 3-4 times in a game, this can straight up save
you 2-3 actions. His value increases even more if someone plays a TP occ, since

than 5 fields is usually a waste of space due to Agricola's scoring cap on
fields, veggies and grain.",3,https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/458895/card-card-full-review-improvements-agricola-v105,I (K) - E (C)

before the first harvest, you're pretty much dead in the water. On the other
hand, if no one wants to plow in the first round (and, in my opinion, no one
should), you can potentially get a huge amount of wood from this guy. Obviously the ideal play is to play him and plow in the first round, and then
collect the wood and reed necessary to build a room and a stable. From there
you should be able to use the wood to build a ton of fences, cementing your
lead for the rest of the game. Yeah, I'm a dreamer.",3,https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/436563/card-card-full-review-occupations-agricola-v111,D (E-K)
266,Ratcatcher,"Ratcatcher On the surface, you're trading 1 food and 1 action for 2 actions from your
opponents. That's ok. However, the card is actually much subtler than that. For
one, the action you spend to play him comes before the actions that your
opponents lose. Since actions are more valuable in the early rounds than the
later ones, this makes him a worse deal than he seems. But it's actually even more complex than that. Because the game is designed to
have more appealing spots as the game progresses, removing 3 or 4 actions from
a given round will mean that the quality of your final actions in that round
will be much higher than usual. As a whole, this is a card that I get out if I have the time, but don't sweat
too much if I need to use my actions in round 9 to develop my own board.",3,https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/436563/card-card-full-review-occupations-agricola-v111,H (K-E)

steep. If you really want to deny your opponents reed, it's often correct to
just take the reed spot yourself. Like all of the buyers, this has the most use in hands where you are able to
get a ton of early game food. Cards like the Dancer or Seasonal Worker

and 5-p reed becomes more plentiful, making him substantially worse. Still, in
any case he will tend to save you a full action, since 4 reed usually takes 2
actions to get. I don't buy the 'this gives your opponents more reed' argument that
WhiteKong uses in his 'Complex Strategies for Agricola' article. In
order to build rooms, people need both reed AND wood. The action that the Reed
Collector saves you lets you take wood instead, setting you up for a potential
2 room play and denying your opponents from rooms just as surely as if you had
taken the reed.",3,https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/436563/card-card-full-review-occupations-agricola-v111,C (E-K)

all of the reed gets taken by your opponents. This is obviously best in 2-p and
3-p games, where reed is a key resource. In 4-p and 5-p, reed is plentiful
enough to give this more limited utility. Still, in some cases it can save you
a full action that you would have otherwise had to spend on reed.",3,https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/458895/card-card-full-review-improvements-agricola-v105,I (K) - E (C)
270,Reed Hut,"Reed Hut Reed Hut Played early, this pretty much wins the game on
the spot. The card is a surprise punch in the gut. After you have 2 reed, your
opponents may often let you easily get your 3rd and 4th reed, reasoning that it
isn't worth much to you. If you can get 4 reed early, it's very difficult
to lose. The Reed Hut plays like an even more powerful Lover: unlike the Lover,
you can continue to expand your family after you've played the card. Also,
while the Lover can be denied food after it has been played, once a person
plays the reed hut, you have pretty much already lost. In 3-p, the card is reasonably balanced by the
fact that reed is extremely scarce; most of the time, your opponents simply
aren't going to let you get 4 reed if they're even reasonably competent. In
other player modes, however, the card is borderline broken. I've considered
removing it from the deck multiple times.",5,https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/458895/card-card-full-review-improvements-agricola-v105,I (K) - E (C)

other players are scrambling for the reed, you can just play out occupations
and then this, avoiding the fight altogether. In other modes, playing this late

for renovation. While three occupations is a lot, this has a strong enough

gives you a boost towards eventually getting the bonus. However, a key problem
with the Reeve is that he's an early game occ. Usually in games where I want to
play a lot of Occs, it's because I have a lot of good early game Occs. When I
have a lot of early game Occs, I tend to prioritize getting them out before the
Reeve, and often the opportunity to get 4 wood has passed by at that point. Nonetheless, he is definitely one of the stronger 4/3/2/1 occs.",3,https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/436563/card-card-full-review-occupations-agricola-v111,H (K-E)

directly to deny your opponents.",2,https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/436563/card-card-full-review-occupations-agricola-v111,H (K-E)

the order that this forces you to take resources is what you actually want to
do. The main problem is the three clay - how often do you actually want to take
3 clay times in a game, especially if you get bonus clay every time you do so? Because of this, his value varies wildly based on the number of players. In
2-p, this guy is amazing and is probably a must play. 2-p is very much a denial
game, and this guy makes it pretty much impossible to deny you from either clay
or reed. In other modes, he is still a fine play, but often you will have

favorite plow. For one, the 4W, 3 Occ price tag is extremely steep. Second,
since every field after the 5th is generally unnecessary, maximizing the plow's
value requires that you don't plow a single field before you play the card out.
Even then, you still get an almost useless 6th field. Many times I've seen players excitedly play this
card out, only to be disappointed in their final score. A lot of the time, the
exorbitant cost on the card (coupled with the hidden cost of not being able to

286,Seed Seller,"Seed Seller If you are going to want 2 grain to sow into 2 fields, he is always worth it.
The grain he gives at the start negates his food cost, and from there you only
have to spend 1 action to get the 2 grain you need. Either way you have spent 2
actions to get 2 grain. However, the real way this guy shines is for 'lazy' baking, where you
don't bother plowing fields until stage 3 or even stage 4. In most games, you
won't have the time to plow fields early, and will need to spend most of your
actions on family growth. This guy lets you delay sowing fields at all - just
take more grain every time you run out. While I don't play him every time I get him, he is a good incentive to go
baking, especially in larger games.",3,https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/436563/card-card-full-review-occupations-agricola-v111,G (I-K)
287,Serf,"Serf Early game he generates some extra grain to help you along with baking, and
late game he gets back the action you spent to play him by giving you a veggie.

you already wanted to bake anyway (excluding hands when you have the Baker).",3,https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/436563/card-card-full-review-occupations-agricola-v111,H (K-E)
288,Sheep Farmer,"Sheep Farmer This is a personal favorite. Early game he guarantees you a breeding pair of
sheep- just take the thing at one sheep. Middle game he generates a ton of food
and denies other people sheep, as you can camp the square at 2 sheep. Late game
he saves you at least one action by giving you Boar and Cattle. I usually play
him with the intention of getting to 7 sheep, at which point I can convert 6 of
them into breeding pairs of cattle and boar. A great trick which not everyone knows about is that if you have a cooking
hearth and take the sheep square at 2 sheep, you can immediately convert the 3
sheep into a boar and a cattle. This will net you 7 food for one action, and is
incredibly powerful. Unlike most Occs, this guy is useful for pretty much the entire game. Well
worth getting out.",4,https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/436563/card-card-full-review-occupations-agricola-v111,D (E-K)
289,Sheep Whisperer,"Sheep Whisperer The best part about this card is the picture, which shows a dude using a
megaphone to 'whisper' to his sheep. Priceless. Unfortunately, like the Boar Whisperer, he's a decidedly underwhelming card. By
the time most of the sheep actually come, you don't even care anymore. He
needed to give a breeding pair before the second harvest to be playable. You're
better off spending the action building up your farm so that you can be the
first person to get a breeding pair of sheep.",1,https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/436563/card-card-full-review-occupations-agricola-v111,D (E-K)
290,Shepherd,"Shepherd I gave the Sheep Whisperer one star, and this is even worse than that. There's
simply no way you're going to be able to get 4 sheep and room for two more
before the second harvest, so you're only going to get a maximum of 4 extra
sheep from him. The Sheep Whisperer gives the same amount of food, and doesn't
force you to already have sheep just to get more sheep. Like all things in
Agricola, sheep have diminishing returns - if you already have 4 sheep, there
isn't much value in getting 4 more.",1,https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/436563/card-card-full-review-occupations-agricola-v111,D (E-K)

292,Shepherd's Crook,"Shepherd's Crook Shepherd's Crook 2 sheep for 1 wood is an amazing deal, pure and
simple. Unfortunately, the huge requirement of wood (9!) prevents this from
being useful in the early game. If you're planning on using sheep for early
food, you probably have better options. However, for someone who's found a way
to eat early without sheep, you can't beat this efficiency as part of a mid to
late game fence play.",3,https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/458895/card-card-full-review-improvements-agricola-v105,I (K) - E (C)
293,Shepherd's Pipe,"Shepherd's Pipe Shepherd's Pipe There's a bit of a chicken and egg problem here.
Before you can get room for sheep, you have to have sheep! The optimal use for
the card is to build a stable, get exactly two sheep, and use this to make room
for your lamb in the next harvest. However, putting this narrow plan into
action is difficult, as you won't always have time to play a minor improvement
in the tiny window between getting the two sheep and going to harvest.",2,https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/458895/card-card-full-review-improvements-agricola-v105,I (K) - E (C)
294,Simple Fireplace,"Simple Fireplace Simple Fireplace This is another card that can ruin the early
fireplace. If you take SP with it for the final round of actions, you will be
able to eat the sheep (albeit inefficiently) and hose the fireplace buyer that
was letting them accumulate. After that, the free upgrade to a Cooking Hearth
should be able to get you a decent long-term feeding strategy. Particularly in advanced games, when your
opponents understand the importance of the first fireplace, this can be an
excellent offensive tactical card. It can also be a reasonably cheap way to get
a Cooking Hearth.",4,https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/458895/card-card-full-review-improvements-agricola-v105,I (K) - E (C)

The stone in the cost means that you won't be able to play it early.
Additionally, the presence of only one or two other players give this dubious
utility. There's a good chance that if someone is eating animals, that someone
is you! In 4-p and 5-p, this card obviously increases in
value, both for the increased number of players and for the earlier access to
stone. If you rush this out, it can ensure a hefty, albeit unreliable, windfall

297,Slaughterman,"Slaughterman This guy can generate a lot of food, but most of that food will come fairly

298,Sleeping Corner,"Sleeping Corner Sleeping Corner The two grain field requirement usually means that
this won't be relevant until FG w/o Room comes out. At that stage, depending on
the number of players, its effect can range from huge to OK. In 2-p, you're
usually better off denying your opponent from the square than passively
preventing yourself from being denied. Is the effect worth getting two grain fields sown
if you're ranching? Probably not, since just getting those two fields sown will
probably cost more actions than the FG w/o Room will give you, and grain is a
pretty terrible way to score points in the end game. However, if you're already
sowing grain, this can be aces in a crowded game.",3,https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/458895/card-card-full-review-improvements-agricola-v105,I (K) - E (C)

you're going to have to use both of his abilities. This is a bad idea, because
contrary to popular belief, Agricola does not reward diversification - it
rewards last minute last minute diversification. In the early game,
you want to specialize into a specific food engine, which goes against what the

that, the 3 stone should make securing the first stone renovation trivial, at

million points. This is one of the few cards that encourage early renovation that I actually

Still, most of the time you don't end up eating vegetables, as they're too
valuable in terms of points and come at an awkward stage in the game. Clearly
if you plan on eating vegetables, this is a must-play. If you're not sure one
way or the other, the fact that it's free means that either way it won't be too
big of a mistake.",3,https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/458895/card-card-full-review-improvements-agricola-v105,I (K) - E (C)
302,Spindle,"Spindle Spindle If you plan on herding sheep, this is worth
bringing out every time. Once you get to 3 sheep you will essentially be
getting 3 food every harvest, since you can get 1 food in the field phase, then
slaughter a sheep to make room for the lamb. All told, the Spindle should be a
no mess 3-5 food, depending on how early you get your sheep.",3,https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/458895/card-card-full-review-improvements-agricola-v105,I (K) - E (C)
303,Spinney,"Spinney Spinney In 2-p this is sometimes worth rushing out. The
lack of any other wood spot means that you can essentially starve your opponent
out of wood completely in the mid to late game. It's almost never worth
spending an action to get two wood and give your opponent one, so often you
will be able to take the wood spot for the rest of the game. In all other
modes, this has less of an effect, but is still an annoying card that will
easily pay its cost back with interest, either by giving you the wood directly
or dissuading an opponent from taking wood. You should think of this as a
slight incentive to get to three occupations.",3,https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/458895/card-card-full-review-improvements-agricola-v105,I (K) - E (C)
304,Spit Roast,"Spit Roast Spit Roast This version of the Spindle is more flexible,
albeit less powerful. Since you can hold a temporary sacrificial lamb in your
house, it's not hard to get this to most of the harvests after you play it,
making it good for at least 3-4 food. However, the downside is that if you
sacrifice your final sheep to get the food bonus, you're going to have to grab
sheep again in order to cancel out the negative. Nonetheless, this comes out most of the time I
plan on getting a Fireplace or Cooking Hearth.",3,https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/458895/card-card-full-review-improvements-agricola-v105,I (K) - E (C)

since you will always have the option to buy full priced stables later, when

himself. Still, you take what you can get, and often you

you grow your family. Viewed strictly as a 3 point play, the card is fairly

359,Wet Nurse,"Wet Nurse This is a great occupation that is also heavily overrated. The Wet Nurse has
three weaknesses: 1) It lets other players use the FG spot. 2) The extra food cost is very significant when you are also doing FG. 3) No minor improvement. If you only use the Wet Nurse's ability once, you spend 2 actions (1 for the
Occ, 1 for the build rooms) and 2 food. This is pretty much strictly worse than
the regular path, which spends 2 actions (1 for build rooms, 1 for minor
improvement) and no food, and gets you a minor improvement. So in order to get your money's worth, you're going to need to use the ability
twice. In that case, you're spending 3 food and 2 actions when you could be
spending no food and 3 actions, getting 2 minor improvements along the way.
Again, this is not a great trade. What makes the Wet Nurse actually playable is when you can use her to get FG
earlier than you otherwise could. In that case, you are actually conserving 1
or 2 more actions than the analysis above would indicate. However, I've hopefully indicated that the Wet Nurse does not speed up your
first family growth much, if any, because you have to spend a turn playing the
Wet Nurse. Saying, 'she prevents me from being blocked' is not a very good
argument because she also prevents you from blocking someone else! One very
valid point is if the FG spot comes out late and you are on the ball on
resources, she definitely can help to speed up your first FG. But if the FG spot comes in the first or second round of stage 2, the only way
the Wet Nurse will be actually 'broken' is when she speeds up your second second FG. For this, several things have to
happen. A) She has to be get the resources necessary to build 2 rooms. B) She has to have enough food to use the ability AND feed the offspring. C) She has to meet conditions A and B relatively quickly. If you are letting one of your opponents get 10 wood, 4 reed, and plenty of
food in the early game, chances are you're not losing because of a broken
occupation. That said, she's still almost always worth playing, and you should be happy
whenever you draw her. While she's unlikely to win you the game by herself,
she's certainly a good start.",5,https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/436563/card-card-full-review-occupations-agricola-v111,H (K-E)

369,Wood Distributor,"Wood Distributor This card is the most interesting in 2-p. If you play it early, the idea is to
control the wood flow for the rest of the game. If the best spot on the board
is wood, take it. If the best spot is clay, fishing, or reed, then split the
wood and take one of those. Doing so can essentially deny your opponent the
second best spot. He also makes taking SP to get 6 wood a fruitless endeavor,
for obvious reasons. He has much less utility, however, as you increase the number of players. Not
only are you starting player less often (reducing the number of times when you
can put a wood on reed and then take it), but you're also less interested in
trying to deny any one of your opponents. One use for him is to combo him with occupations like the Berry Picker,
Mushroom Collector, Woodcutter, etc. In those situations, he can be pretty
abusive. A [if gte vml 1]><v:shape id='Picture_x0020_17'
